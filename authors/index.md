  My formal training is in cognitive and cultural anthropology. I’m also a self-trained data scientist. My ethnographic skills help me adapt to unfamiliar settings, see things holistically, and tie analytic goals to on-the-ground concerns. My statistical and programming skills help me tackle noisy data, find hard-to-find patterns, automate a lot of my work, and collaborate effectively with engineers and analysts. Data science makes me a better anthropologist and anthropology makes me a better data scientist. I started out doing social-movement research in Central Asia, then switched to working counter-insurgency issues for the U.S. Department of the Army, then managed the marketing research and web teams of an educational travel firm, and now I work for a financial services startup. I'm a minimalist when it comes to theory, a pragmatist when it comes to methods, and an opportunist when it comes to research topics. I once ate sheep face, drank sulphur water, and got sunstroke (all in the same day) in order to score an interview I needed.

  I'm a data scientist with an academic research background in anthropology and social psychology. I like work that combines rigorous descriptive and inferential statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic decision-making with behavioral science and ethnography. I've worked as an analyst and research scientist for the U.S. Deparment of the Army, the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and the Psychology Department and Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. As a data science consultant I've worked with data science and gamification startups, and with data from mobile phones and sensor-systems, peer-to-peer lending platforms, healthcare cost-reporting, and restaurant and hotel reviews. I was a 2013 Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow with the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. I'm currently based in Singapore, but I've also lived, spent time, and worked in Turkey, Afghanistan, India, and Thailand.
