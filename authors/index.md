  My formal training is in cognitive and cultural anthropology. I’m also a self-trained data scientist. I started out doing social-movement research in Central Asia, then switched to working counter-insurgency issues for the U.S. Department of the Army, then managed the marketing research and web teams of an educational travel firm, then worked for an asset-managment startup, and for the last few years I've been building a data science team for New York City's largest charter school network.

  I'm a data scientist with an academic research background in anthropology and social psychology. I like work that combines rigorous descriptive and inferential statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic decision-making with behavioral science and ethnography. I've worked as an analyst and research scientist for the U.S. Deparment of the Army, the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and the Psychology Department and Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. As a data science consultant I've worked with data science and gamification startups, and with data from mobile phones and sensor-systems, peer-to-peer lending platforms, healthcare cost-reporting, and restaurant and hotel reviews. I was a 2013 Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow with the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. I'm currently based in Singapore and Mumbai.
