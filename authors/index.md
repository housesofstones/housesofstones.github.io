  Most of my formal training was in traditional anthropological theories and methods (long-term immersive research, participant observation, narrative-style, interpretive analyses, etc.), but later expanded to include neuroscience-based theory and statistics-based methods. My experiences working as an analyst for the U.S. Department for the Army confirmed and strengthened my commitment to systematic approaches to research. I feel a little silly calling myself an anthropologist, since I can&#8217;t find any analytic use for concepts like culture or identity, but I don&#8217;t know what else to call myself (&#8220;social scientist&#8221; sounds strange&#8230;and uninformative). I study behavior, which isn&#8217;t (in my mind) the same as studying people. I&#8217;m more interested in shared, emergent behavior than individual actions, and I tend to look for explanations for behavior in the environment to which people adapt rather than in people&#8217;s ideas or words. I&#8217;m a minimalist when it comes to theory and an opportunist when it comes to methods.

  My early graduate training was in anthropology. Since then I&#8217;ve shifted more into computer science and computational social science. I received my MA from Middle East Technical University, in Turkey, and my research considered how people form and participate in groups during post-conflict institution building. After that I worked for two years as a social scientist for the US Army, analyzing irregular conflict and corruption. Currently my research is in the areas of social psychology and implicit social cognition, especially as they relate to institutional corruption. My main interests are in how population-level patterns of behavior emerge from individual-level social interactions and how past and ongoing social interaction constrain behavior. But that kind of research requires far better tools than are common in much of the social science I&#8217;m familiar with. So my focus is on developing ways of using social technologies and applications as behavioral sensors for systematically observing social interaction.
