  Most of my formal training was in traditional anthropological theories and methods (long-term immersive research, participant observation, narrative-style, interpretive analyses, etc.), but later expanded to include neuroscience-based theory and statistics-based methods. My experiences working as an analyst for the U.S. Department for the Army confirmed and strengthened my commitment to systematic approaches to research. I feel a little silly calling myself an anthropologist, since I can&#8217;t find any analytic use for concepts like culture or identity, but I don&#8217;t know what else to call myself (&#8220;social scientist&#8221; sounds strange&#8230;and uninformative). I study behavior, which isn&#8217;t (in my mind) the same as studying people. I&#8217;m more interested in shared, emergent behavior than individual actions, and I tend to look for explanations for behavior in the environment to which people adapt rather than in people&#8217;s ideas or words. I&#8217;m a minimalist when it comes to theory and an opportunist when it comes to methods.

  I'm a data scientist with an academic research background in anthropology and social psychology. I like work that combines rigorous descriptive and inferential statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic decision-making with behavioral science and ethnography. I've worked as an analyst and research scientist for the U.S. Deparment of the Army, the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and the Psychology Department and Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. As a data science consultant I've worked with data science and gamification startups, and with data from mobile phones and sensor-systems, peer-to-peer lending platforms, healthcare cost-reporting, and restaurant and hotel reviews. I was a 2013 Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellow with the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. I'm currently based in Singapore, but I've also lived, spent time, and worked in Turkey, Afghanistan, India, and Thailand.
