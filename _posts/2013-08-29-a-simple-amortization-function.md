I was working on a project yesterday where I needed to amortize out a bunch of loans to calculate the total interest a borrower would pay if he or she paid the minimum monthly payment for the full term of the loan. I couldn&#8217;t find any package in R that already contained the necessary math, so I looked around and found [this post][1] as well as [this one][2]. They both presented the R code to do the basic math involved in amortization, but each function was built to handle only one loan at a time. I had well over 100,000 loans I needed to go through, and loops aren&#8217;t all that efficiently implemented in R.<!--more-->

So I revised the code to perform that math on all of the loans at once by organizing everything into matrices that could then be added, subtracted, etc. It only took a little over three seconds to amortizeÂ 110,335 loans. I don&#8217;t know how long it would have taken to amortize each loan individually &#8211; I killed the process after I got tired of waiting for it to finish.

The function takes the following parameters:

*   **p_input**: the initial principal owed on the loan
*   **i_input**: the interest rate
*   **n_months**: the length of the loan term, in months
*   **output**: format of the output; &#8220;list&#8221; returns a list of full amortization tables (balance, payment, principal, interest, and installment for each month); &#8220;table&#8221; combines all the individual tables into one and differentiates loans by a separate index column; &#8220;balance&#8221;, &#8220;payment&#8221; &#8220;principal&#8221;, and &#8220;interest&#8221; return only those columns
*   **index**: an id number or other unique identifier for each loan; if not supplied, the loans are just numbered
